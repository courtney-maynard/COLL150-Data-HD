# November 4th, Class Essay

### 11/4 Essay: We have five reading/watching slots left on our schedule. I'm looking to replace one that's there now I think is on the weaker side (Thursday 11/18) and I want your help. What topic haven't we discussed (or will discuss) within the realm of data science and/or human development that you would like covered and discussed in class? Is there a particular video or reading you are aware of that you like or think is valuable that you want the rest of the class to see/read? Briefly explain your thoughts and provide a link, if applicable. I will read your responses later today. You have until 10:05.


One topic that we haven’t discussed yet that I think would be interesting is the ethics of data science and human development studies. I think that it would be helpful to know what are some possible ethical challenges to using data science to aid human development or ethical challenges to data science and human development as separate, larger topics.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnU0hm7uA_k
I just found this youtube video relating to what data scientists should learn about and consider regarding ethics. I haven’t seen it but by looking through the timestamps as well as the comments, which this time are not trash-talking Bill Gates, it seems that the video topic is explained well and that it is a worthwhile topic to explore further.
