# Courtney Maynard's COLL150 Work

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Courtney Maynard and I am interested in majoring in CAMS(Computational And Applied Mathematics And Statistics) on the Applied Statistics track and minoring in music. I have some coding experience but none in data science, so I am super excited to take this course! In my free time, I enjoy doing anything outside (hiking, backpacking, running, hammocking, biking, etc.) as well as singing and songwriting.
