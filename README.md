# Courtney Maynard's COLL150 Work

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Courtney Maynard and I am interested in majoring in Computer Science minoring in economics or data science or business analytics. I have some coding experience but none in data science, so I am super excited to take this course! In my free time, I enjoy doing anything outside (hiking, backpacking, running, hammocking, biking, etc.) as well as singing and songwriting. On campus, I am involved in Alpha Phi Omega, Team Blitz, and Society of Women In Computing.
